# Mathematical Expression and Strings

## Algorithms
a set of instructions to process code
- uses user input and creates possible steps

*flowcharts*
use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm
- different shapes represent different 

*Operations*
- % represents "modules" ; gives the remainder

*Strings*
- collection of characters
- certain procedures can be used to evaluate strings
substring("abcdefghi", 2, 5) = bcde
concat() combines strings
