# Mathematical Expression and Strings

## Algorithms
An algorithm: a set of instructions that can accomplish a specific task

### An Algorithm has three 
1. Sequencing: Algorithms do taks in the order of specification
2. Selection: Helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision
3. Iteration: If a conditions is true, then the code can repeat

### Algorithms can be Represented in Two Ways
1.*Flowcharts*: Use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm

A*flowcharts*
use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm
- different shapes represent different functions
- For example, the circle represents the start and end whereas an arrow represents a relationship between relative shapes. There is also a rectangle, parallelogram, and diamond which have their specific functions.
- Pseudocode: A blend of human language and coding format

## Arithmetic Operations
Arithmetic operations exist in most programming languages

### Basic Operations
Subtraction:
- represented by "-"
Ex: num1 = 2 - 1

Addition:
- represented by "+"
Ex: num1 = 2 +1

Multiplication
- represented by "*"
Ex: num1 = 2 * 1

Division
- represented by "/"
num1 = 2/1

Getting the Remainder
represented by "MOD" (% in python)
num1 = 5 % 2

## Different Uses
Items can be numbers or variables
Example:
num1 = 10
num2 = num1 -25
num3 = 100 * num1
num4 = num1 / num2
num5 = 9 % num4

## Order of Operations
Arithmetic operations in programming are performed in the same order as operations in mathematics:
- operations in parentheses should be done first
- division and multiplication should be done before addition and subtraction
- modulus works similar to multiplication and division
Example: Evaluate num1
num1 = 9 % 2 * (8 - 2) + 8 / (6 - 4)
num1 = 10.0

## Variables
