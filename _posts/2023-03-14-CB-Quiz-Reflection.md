- Explanation: The key to these types of questions is that I need to select TWO correct answers. Here, I chose Answer C which is wrong because this sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1. I should've chosen Answer D instead because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet.

- Incorrect. This information cannot be determined using the data collected. The data does not include information about the costs of individual items, so it is impossible to find the most expensive item purchased on a given date. 
Correct. For each transaction, the data includes the date of the transaction and the number of items purchased in the transaction. By searching the data to find all transactions that occurred on the given date, and then adding the number of items purchased in each of those transactions, the total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined.

- The information in the products list can be used to create a list of the product IDs of all products that use AA batteries. Since the products list and the purchases list have the product ID information in common, the list of product IDs can be used in the purchases list to create a list of customer IDs of all the customers who purchased products that use AA batteries. Finally, since the purchases list and the customers list have the customer ID in common, the list of customer IDs can be used to generate a list of e-mail addresses of the customers who purchased products that use AA batteries.

- To be counted, a show must be a talk show that airs on Saturday or Sunday. Therefore, the AND operator should be used instead of the first OR operator. For a show to be counted, the value of genre must be "talk" and the value of day must be "Saturday" or "Sunday".
