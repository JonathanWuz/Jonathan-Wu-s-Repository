| Category | Expectation | Explanation/Response |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Program Purpose and Function | Describes the purpose of the program, describes the program's functionality, and can take an input and return an output. | The purpose of this program is to provide the user with a way to sort their shipments. Specifically, when a shipment is associated with a specific date, title, or importance. |
| Data Abstraction | Shows how data has been stored in a collection and shows data from that collection as it contributes to the overall purpose of the program. Identifies the name of a variable representing the collection being used and describes what the data contained in the collection represents in the program. | Will store user data through shipment titles, dates, and specificity. For example, if user wants to remove a shipment, I may implement a trash option to delete it. |
| Managing Complexity | Shows a collection of data that manages complexity. Explains an alternative method that would have been more complex and explains why that method could not be used or how it would have to be written differently. | This feature will manage complexity by allowing the user to sort by preferences, not just by name. |
| Procedural Abstraction | Shows a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure, and shows where that procedure is called. Describes how the procedure contributes to the functionality of the program. | This will be clearly done simply just by coding out the necessary steps. Parameter will be included through the use of word limits. |
| Algorithm Implementation | Includes a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. Explains how the algorithm works in detail enough to where someone could recreate it. | Listing inventory into a detailed table that stores the inventory's information will have sufficient algorithms to fit this criteria. |
| Testing | Describe two calls to the selected procedure in response 3c. Each call must pass a argument that causes different outputs. Describes conditions being tested by each call. Identifies the result of each call. | We will test two different features in each section, which test certain conditions and output different results. |

## CPT
Each team member will be programming a special feature for the management system, so the individual create performance tasks will be focused on the respective features. For the n@tm project, we plan on intertwining each feature together to build one large application.

## Code Pertaining to Guidelines
- User should be able to input inventory to keep track of their detailed product in a table
- They should be prompted with a button to click on
- Once clicked, the button should navigate the user to the attributes of the inventory, including things such as the data of input, user name, name of item, and quantity.
- User should then be able to click another button that adds all this into a neat table for the user to view and refer back to whenever needed
- A "delete item" button will be implemented to allow the user to get rid of the item if needed, and an "edit item" will also be implemented so that the user can make changes on the go.

## Video Ideation
I plan to show my aspect of the feature by first, inputting an item into the table, with specified attributes. The next is editing the item once it has already been in display in the neat table, and finally, testing to see the functionality of each selected feature for sorting through the inputted data.
