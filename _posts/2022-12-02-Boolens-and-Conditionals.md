## 3.5 - Boolean Expressions
Here we will focus on: 
- basics of Booleans
- its relationship with binary
- relational operators
- logical operators

### What is a boolean?
A data type with two possible values: true or fals

### Boolean and Binary
So similar yet so different
- Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0.
- However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singular bit
- on the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size

### Must Knows
- A boolean value is either true or false
- The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below.
a = b
a =/ b
a > b
a < b
a >= b
a <= b

- A few ways these operators could be used
- equal, not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to (respectively)

### The versatility of relational operators
