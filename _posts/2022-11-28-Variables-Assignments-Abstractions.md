## Variables, Assignments, and Data Abstractions
An abstraction inside a program that can hold a value

### Naming Variables
Tip: Make variables simple, easy to read, and relatively general for efficient code
Ex: Do: highscore        Don't: highestscoreinthegame

### Types of Data
1. Integer: numbers
2. Text: words
3. Boolean: states if something is true or false

## Assignments
allows a program to be change the value represented by a variable
assigns values to varibales

### Examples
*Example 1*
a=1
a=b
a=2
print(b)
b=1
- will take the most recent value

*Example 2*
num1 = 5
num2 = 9
num1 = num2
print(num1)
9
print(num2)
9

## Data Abstraction
represent data in a useful form; manages complexity
- List and Indexes start at 1
- Maximum number is the # of elements in the list
- string = ordered sequencce of characters

### 3 Types of List operations
1. Assigning values to a list of certain indicies
2. Creating an empty list and assigning it values
3. Assigning a copy of a list
