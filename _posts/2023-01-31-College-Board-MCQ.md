- Overall, I got a 41/50 on the CB MCQ
- This is equivalent to a 82% which is decent but not ideal.
In order to improve this score, there are certain areas that I need to work on:
- looking through the problems I missed, I noticed a lot of my missed questions were on 1.D which consisted of units from 3.6-3.11. Some of these units were: Nested Conditionals, Developing Algorithms, Algorithmic Efficiency, and Binary Search.
- To improve in these areas, I will go back to my notes and review the content. I will also look at the College Board videos and use the examples from my videos to quiz myself. This will hopefully give me a better understanding of content that I'm unfamiliar of and aid me when I take the AP Exam.
