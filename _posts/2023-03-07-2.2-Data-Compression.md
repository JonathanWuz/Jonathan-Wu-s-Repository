# Enumerate "Data" Big Idea from College Board
- "Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data"
- "Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space."
- "lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered"
- "lossless data lets you restore and recover"
The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size.

# Image Files and Sizes
Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog.

- Clouds Impression
- Lassen Volcano
- Green Square

Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ...

- File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab
- Size, height and width, number of pixels
- Visual perception, lossy compression

# Displaying images in Python Jupyter Notebook
Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories

## Ipython
Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML.

## pathlib
File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS's), pathlib is a solution to this problem.

- What are commands you use in terminal to access files?
- What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files?
- What are some of the major differences?
- Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code.

- Why is path a big deal when working with images?
- How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics?
- Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images?

# Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow)
PIL (Python Image Library)
Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images.

### base64
Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal?

Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64.
numpy
Numpy is described as "The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python". In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale.

### io, BytesIO
Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags.

Where have you been a consumer of buffering?
From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering?
How do these effects apply to images?
Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images
Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program.

Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed?
Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code?
Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images?
Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described?

# Data Structures and OOP
Most data structures classes require Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Since this class is lined up with a College Course, OOP will be talked about often. Functionality in remainder of this Blog is the same as the prior implementation. Highlight some of the key difference you see between imperative and oop styles.

# Read imperative and object-oriented programming on Wikipedia
Consider how data is organized in two examples, in relations to procedures
Look at Parameters in Imperative and Self in OOP

## Additionally, review all the imports in these three demos. Create a definition of their purpose, specifically these ...
- PIL
- numpy
- base64
