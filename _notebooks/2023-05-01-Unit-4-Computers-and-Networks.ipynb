    "## How a Computer Works\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have learned, a computer needs aa program to do something smart. The sequence of a program initiates a series of actions with the computers Central Processing Unit (CPU). This component is essentially a binary machine focussing on program instructions provided. The CPU retrieives and stores the data it acts upon in Random Access Memory (RAM). Between the CPU, RAM, and Storage Devices a computer can work with many programs and large amounts of data.\n",

    "The basic parts of a computer are: Input devices: These devices allow users to input data into the computer, such as the keyboard, mouse, and microphone. Output devices: These devices allow users to see or hear the results of the computer’s processing, such as the monitor, printer, and speakers. Storage devices: These devices store data that is not currently being used by the computer, such as the hard drive, CD-ROM, and DVD-ROM. Central processing unit (CPU): The CPU is the “brain” of the computer. It is responsible for carrying out the instructions that are given to it by the computer’s software. Memory: Memory is used to store data that is currently being used by the computer, such as the operating system, applications, and data files.\n",

    "Essential Knowledge\n",
    "- The internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonproprierary) communication protocols.\n",
    "- Access to the internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an internet connected device.\n",
    "- A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.\n",
    "- The protocols used in the internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the internet.\n",
    "- Routing on the internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance\n",
    "- The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands.\n",
    "- The internet was designed to be scalable\n",
    "- Information is passed through the internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets.\n",
    "- Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the internet, as well as for data reassembly.\n",
    "- Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all\n",
    "- IP, TCP and UDP are common protocols used on the internet.\n",
    "- The world wide web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files.\n",
    "- HTTP is a protocol used by the world wide web\n",
    "- The world wide web uses the internet\n",
    "- Go over AP videos, vocabulary, and essential knowledge. Draw a diagram showing the internet and its many levels. A preferred diagram would using your knowledge of frontend, backend, deployment, etc. Picture would highligh vocabulary by illustration. The below illustration have some ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "- Often we draw pictures of machines communicating over the Internet with arrows. However, the real communication goes through protocol layers and the machine and then is trasported of the network. For College Board and future Computer Knowledge you should become familiar with the following …\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fault Tolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch both daily videos for 4.2\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the network activity, summarize your understanding of fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fault tolerance is a process that lets an OS respond to failure in the hardware or software. So the system won’t break down completely due to an error or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parallel and Distributed Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Review previous lecture on Parallel Computing and watch Daily vidoe 4.3. Think of ways to make something in you team project to utilize Cores more effectively. Here are some thoughts to add to your story of Computers and Networks…\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is naturally Distributed in Frontend/Backend archeticture?\n",
    "    - The frontend and backend of a web application are naturally distributed. The frontend is typically hosted on a web server, which is a single machine. The backend, on the other hand, can be distributed across multiple machines. This is because the backend typically consists of different components, such as a database, a web server, and an application server. Each of these components can be hosted on its own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze this command in Docker: ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=\"--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086\". Determine if there is options are options in this command for parallel computing within the server that runs python/gunicorn. Here is an article\n",
    "    - The command ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=”–workers=1 –bind=0.0.0.0:8086” sets the environment variable GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS to the value “–workers=1 –bind=0.0.0.0:8086”. The GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS environment variable is used to pass additional command line arguments to Gunicorn.\n",

    "Last week we discussed parallel computing on local machine. There are many options. Here is something to get parallel computing work with a tool called Ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review this article… Can you get parallel code on images to work more effectively? I have not tried Ray.\n",
