<h2 id="questions">
<a class="anchor" href="#questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit</li>
  <li>Think of a potential harmful effect of your project.</li>
  <li>Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year:  What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?</li>
  <li>What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide?  For yourself or for others.</li>
</ul>

  <li>One beneficial effect of our project is that it makes shipping easier because everything is stored and accounted for. Another beneficial effect is that interactions can be done through our project. Also, people can jot down their thoughts and communicate via our project.</li>
  <li>A potentially harmful effect of our project is that it may be inconvenient for users if not enough people use our project. If most shipping transactions outside of our website, our users would need to view these actions elsewhere, making our project minimal if not used consistently.</li>
  <li>Pros are that internet blockers prevent people from accessing inappropriate websites. Websites that aure untrustworthy, addicting, or distracting can all be restricted. However, the harmful effects of internet blockers is that students can’t access necessary tools that are helpful. For example, web restrictions prevent students from accessing AWS and forces them to use a vpn.</li>
  <li>I’m concerned about the digital divide and how restrictions can prevent someone from learning. For students at this school, internet restrictions and lack of tools can be harmful and inconvenient. For less fortunate schools, I’m concerned that they have no tools at all, making them unable to learn or code.</li>
