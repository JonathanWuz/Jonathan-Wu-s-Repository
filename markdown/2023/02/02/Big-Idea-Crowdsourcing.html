<p>The more you crowdsource, the more you reach beyond your own community, the more likely you will reduce Computer Bias. Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing.</p>

<h2 id="evidence-of-crowdsourcing">
<a class="anchor" href="#evidence-of-crowdsourcing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Evidence of Crowdsourcing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing, see Wikipedia definition on crowdsourcing. It can have inaccuracies, but when it does it often is corrected through a self-policing community. Reviews and many authors have made this, according to many, better than “official” information.</li>
  <li>Crypto currency and associated block chain. All exchanges of money are validated at least 3-times by independent miners. If there is a flaw in the independent calculations the process is checked and performed again. Innovation of crypto crowdsourcing has impact on how governments think about currency. Additionally, block chain algorithms are being considered for many other crowdsourcing most private data (ie medical records).</li>
  <li>COVID data, it is easy to recognize areas that are contributing and not contributing. This data has impacted all our lives and decision we make on attending public events, flying on planes, or wearing masks. The community of data and analysts will spawn many new ways of thinking about data that impacts lives.</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#obtaining-data-via-crowdsourcing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Obtaining Data Via Crowdsourcing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used.</li>
  <li>We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?
    <ul>
      <li>The biggest discovery I have found on Github is the ability to add images and adjust them using html and css. I can also organize many other things such as tables or texts which allows for interesting designs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting?
    <ul>
      <li>The data sets are usually about a certain issue and present data useful in supporting a certain claim. For example, one such data set is Video game, Crime, Drop-out data set. This data set reveals correlations between videogames and crime which is not relevant for our project but can be used to prove a claim.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Think of a use case for crowdsourcing in you project …</p>
<ul>
  <li>CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
    <ul>
      <li>We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of us have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Another way we can crowdsource is by having people outside of CSP review our website. This will allow fresh users to make comments that’ll likely avoid bias.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?
    <ul>
      <li>Del Norte crowdsourcing comes in many forms. AP Stat students may ask questions from different classes to gather data to their questions. ASB elects officials through a democratic vote which is another example of crowdsourcing. We can crowdsource in our own project by asking for user input.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.
    <ul>
      <li>One piece of data I could capture at N@tM is parent and student feedback. I’ll ask them “how can we improve our website?” Then, using the data I gather, I will implement them and show them to Mr. Mort potentially to show usage of crowdsourcing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
