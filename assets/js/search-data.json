A data type with two possible values: true or fals . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singular bit | on the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A boolean value is either true or false | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below. a = b a =/ b a &gt; b a &lt; b a &gt;= b a &lt;= b . | A few ways these operators could be used | equal, not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to (respectively) | . Logical Operators . These types of operators don’t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular bollean result . AND: returns TRUE if the operand around it are TRUE | OR: returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT: returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . Lesson 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on a Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as “if statements” can be seen as if statements or if blocks Ex: if (condition) [Block of Statements] can be seen as if else of if else-blocks Ex: if (condition) [Block of Statements] . x=20 y=10 if x &gt; y: print(“x is greater than y”) . x=20 y=10 if x&gt;y: print(“x is greater than y”) else: print(“x is not greater than y”) . Lesson 3.7 - nested Conditionals . Nested conditionals statements consist of conditional statements within other conditional statements | Utilizes “if else” statements within “if else” satements | basics of a nested conditional | . Analyzing Code Walkthrough . Pseuocode to the left, block code to the right | Approach the problem by going through each condition one at a time | decide which ones are false to skip and which ones are tru to execute | .",

Sequencing: Algorithms do taks in the order of specification | Selection: Helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision | Iteration: If a conditions is true, then the code can repeat | Algorithms can be Represented in Two Ways . 1.Flowcharts: Use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm . Aflowcharts use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm . different shapes represent different functions | For example, the circle represents the start and end whereas an arrow represents a relationship between relative shapes. There is also a rectangle, parallelogram, and diamond which have their specific functions. | Pseudocode: A blend of human language and coding format | . Arithmetic Operations . Arithmetic operations exist in most programming languages . Basic Operations . Subtraction: . represented by “-“ Ex: num1 = 2 - 1 | . Addition: . represented by “+” Ex: num1 = 2 +1 | . Multiplication . represented by “*” Ex: num1 = 2 * 1 | . Division . represented by “/” num1 = 2/1 | . Getting the Remainder represented by “MOD” (% in python) num1 = 5 % 2 . Different Uses . Items can be numbers or variables Example: num1 = 10 num2 = num1 -25 num3 = 100 * num1 num4 = num1 / num2 num5 = 9 % num4 . Order of Operations . Arithmetic operations in programming are performed in the same order as operations in mathematics: . operations in parentheses should be done first | division and multiplication should be done before addition and subtraction | modulus works similar to multiplication and division Example: Evaluate num1 num1 = 9 % 2 * (8 - 2) + 8 / (6 - 4) num1 = 10.0 | . Variables . Different Ways Values are Stored in Variables . Numerical value stored in a variable | Value of another variable stored in a variable | result of an operation stored in a variable | Result of a procedure call stored in a variable | score = 0 score = newScore score = newScore + 2 avgScore = allscores(20, 60, 80) . Sequencing is Important! . Changing the order of the steps changes the overall outcome, since every time the value assigned to a variable is changed, it overrides the last value which was assigned to the same variable. That is why it is important to track the value of variables, especially in code where the value is constantly changing. . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 + num3 num2 = num1 + num3 Vs. num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num2 = num1 + num3 num1 = num2 + num3 . Tracking Variables . Tracking variables is a common question found on AP exams and is an important thing to keep in mind when writing any code. If the value of your variables changes a lot, not accounting for these changes can result in an unwanted outcome. . var1 = 9 var2 = 7 var3 = 2 print(var1) print(var2) print(var3) .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is not a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .
