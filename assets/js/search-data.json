            "content": "Libraries . A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . API&#8217;s . An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code. | . Activity: Walkthrough with NumPy . Install NumPy on VSCode: Open New Terminal In VSCode: | pip3 install --upgrade pip | pip install numpy | | . REMEMBER: When running library code cells use Python Interpreter Conda (Version 3.9.12) . Example of using NumPy for arrays: . import numpy as np new_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]) print (new_matrix) . [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] . Example of using NumPy for derivatives: . import numpy as np # defining polynomial function var = np.poly1d([2, 0, 1]) print(&quot;Polynomial function, f(x): n&quot;, var) # calculating the derivative derivative = var.deriv() print(&quot;Derivative, f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative) # calculates the derivative of after # given value of x print(&quot;When x=5 f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative(5)) . Polynomial function, f(x): 2 2 x + 1 Derivative, f(x)&#39;= 4 x When x=5 f(x)&#39;= 20 . Random Values . Random number generation (RNG) produces a random number (crazy right?) This means that a procedure with RNG can return different values even if the parameters (inputs) do not change | . | CollegeBoard uses RANDOM(A, B), to return an integer between integers A and B. RANDOM(1, 10) can output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 | In Python, this would be random.randint(A, B), after importing Python&#39;s &quot;random&quot; library (import random) | JavaScript&#39;s works a little differently, with Math.random() returning a value between 0 and 1. To match Python and CollegeBoard, you could make a procedure like this | . | . | . CollegeBoard Example: What is the possible range of values for answ3 . Convert the following procedure to Python, then determine the range of outputs if n = 5. . PROCEDURE Dice(n) sum ← 0 REPEAT UNTIL n = 0 sum ← sum + RANDOM(1, 6) n ← n - 1 RETURN sum . import random # Fill in the blank n = 1 sum = 0 while n &gt; 0: sum = sum + random.randint(1 , 6) n = n - 1 break n = 0 # Code here print(sum) # Will output a range of __ to __ . 3 . Homework . Write a procedure that generates n random numbers, then sorts those numbers into lists of even and odd numbers (JS or Python, Python will be easier). . | Using NumPy and only coding in python cell, find the answer to the following questions: a. What is the derivative of 2x^5 - 6x^2 + 24x? b. What is the derivative of (13x^4 + 4x^2) / 2 when x = 9? . | Suppose you have a group of 10 dogs and 10 cats, and you want to create a random order for them.

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . def convertFahrenheit(): # code goes here return celsius convertFahrenheit(outsideTemp) . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . currentGrade &lt;- currentPoints / 40 currentGrade &lt;- current Grade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; quizGrade quizGrade &lt;- currentGrade . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | . MOVE_FORWARD()|turnCorner()| ROTATE_RIGHT |MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD()|MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() MOVE_FORWARD MOVE_FORWARD() . Hacks . Write a python procedure about something which can help you in school, for example the teacher’s function we spoke about earlier. | Points will be awarded based on creativity and functionality | 0.1 points will be deducted for late submissions | Submit the notes with all blanks filled in (scored out of 0.5 points) and the python procedure (scored out of 0.5 points) by Monday 12/12 at 11:59 PM. | . def procedure() # code goes here return # code goes here .",

            "content": "Lists and Iterations . Lists . What are lists? . Lists: a sequence of variables . we can use lists to store multiple items into one variable | used to store collections of data | changeable, ordered, allow duplicates | . List examples in Python, JavaScript, and Pseudocode . fruits = [“apple”, “grape”, “strawberry”] print (fruits) . const fruits = [“apple”, “grape”, “strawberry”]; . fruits &lt;- [apple, grape, strawberry] . More List examples . brands = [“nike”, “adidas”, “underarmour”] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] truefalse = [True, False, true] . Lists are just one of four collection data types in Python . Tuple: collection that is ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates | Set: collection that is unordered, unchangeable, doesn’t allow duplicates | Dictionary: collection that is ordered, changeable, doesn’t allow duplicates | . Terms . Index: a term used to sort data in order to reference to an element in a list (allows for duplicates) | Elements: the values in the list assigned to an index | . fruits = [“apple”, “grape”, “strawberry”] index = 1 . print (fruits[index]) . Methods in Lists . append() - adds elements to the end of the list insert() - adds element at given position reverse() - reverses the lsit order count() - returns the amount of elements with the specified value clear() - removes the elements from the list . Try this . Determine the output of the code segment words &lt;- “old”, “car”, “unusual”, “new”, “bold”, “far”, “away” index &lt;- 1 FOR EACH word IN words If LEN(word) = 3 REMOVE(words, index) ELSE index &lt;- index + 1 Display(words) This will output “unusual”, “bold”, “away” | . Iteration . First, what not to do . Iteration is important for your time and sanity Coding a lot of blocks indivisually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There’s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a “for loop”, using a “for loop and range()”, using a “while loop”, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the ‘containers’ that store the data to iterate . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration: define and indefinite. Define iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
