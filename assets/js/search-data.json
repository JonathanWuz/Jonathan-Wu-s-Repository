Order of operations in programming are performed in the same order as operations in mathematics. . Strings . A string is a collection of characters. Can be numbers, letters, spaces, special symbols, etc. String concatenation is combining two or more strings to make a new strings in order to create a new string A substring is a part of and already existing string. . cookie = &quot;choclate&quot; cookie2 = &quot;rasin&quot; len1 = len(cookie) / 2 len1 = str(len1) len2 = len(cookie2) * 45 len2 = str(len2) vote1 = cookie + &quot; vote: &quot; + len2 vote2 = cookie2 + &quot; vote: &quot; + len1 votes = vote1 + &quot; &quot; + vote2 print(votes) . choclate vote: 225 rasin vote: 4.0 . Unit 3 Section 5-7 . A boolean is a data type with two possible values: true or false Relational operators could use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80 . gradeList = [90, 65, 60, 75, 95] averageGrade = sum(gradeList)/len(gradeList) if averageGrade &gt; 80: print(&quot;the average grade is&quot; + averageGrade + &quot;%&quot;) else: print(&quot;The average grade is below 80%&quot;) . The average grade is below 80% . Logical Operators are similar to relational operators but these operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND: returns TRUE if the operand around it are TRUE | OR: returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT: returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . print(&quot;1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12:&quot;, 1&gt;2 or 5 &lt; 12) # NOT function print(&quot;24&gt;8:&quot;, not 24&gt;8) # AND function print(&quot;10&gt;20:&quot;, 10&gt;20 and 20&lt;10) . 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12: True 24&gt;8: False 10&gt;20: False .

Lists are just one of four collection data types in Python . Tuple: collection that is ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates | Set: collection that is unordered, unchangeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | Dictionary: collection that is ordered, changeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | . Terms . Index: a term used to sort data in order to reference to an element in a list (allows for duplicates) | Elements: the values in the list assigned to an index | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;] index = 1 print (fruits[index]) . grape . Methods in Lists . append() - adds elements to the end of the list insert() - adds element at given position reverse() - reverses the lsit order count() - returns the amount of elements with the specified value clear() - removes the elements from the list .

An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can use your own imagination and create whatever you want with your instructions. . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) . It&#39;s too hot outside! . Conditions vs Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. .

Iteration: . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . - Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced - This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . words = [&quot;alfa&quot;, &quot;bravo&quot;, &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;foxtrot&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;india&quot;, &quot;juliett&quot;, &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;lima&quot;, &quot;mike&quot;, &quot;november&quot;, &quot;oscar&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;, &quot;quebec&quot;, &quot;romeo&quot;, &quot;sierra&quot;, &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;, &quot;whiskey&quot;, &quot;xray&quot;, &quot;yankee&quot;, &quot;zulu&quot;] inp = input().lower() output = &quot;&quot; for letter in inp: for word in words: if letter == word[0]: output += word + &quot; &quot; print(inp + &quot; n&quot; + output) . whatever whiskey hotel alfa tango echo victor echo romeo . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) .

Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1.

The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is &quot;halts&quot;. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of &quot;never&quot;. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems.

An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code. | . Activity: Walkthrough with NumPy . Install NumPy on VSCode: Open New Terminal In VSCode: | pip3 install --upgrade pip | pip install numpy | | . REMEMBER: When running library code cells use Python Interpreter Conda (Version 3.9.12) . Example of using NumPy for arrays: . import numpy as np new_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]) print (new_matrix) . [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] . Example of using NumPy for derivatives: . import numpy as np # defining polynomial function var = np.poly1d([2, 0, 1]) print(&quot;Polynomial function, f(x): n&quot;, var) # calculating the derivative derivative = var.deriv() print(&quot;Derivative, f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative) # calculates the derivative of after # given value of x print(&quot;When x=5 f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative(5)) . Polynomial function, f(x): 2 2 x + 1 Derivative, f(x)&#39;= 4 x When x=5 f(x)&#39;= 20 . Random Values . Random number generation (RNG) produces a random number (crazy right?) This means that a procedure with RNG can return different values even if the parameters (inputs) do not change | . | CollegeBoard uses RANDOM(A, B), to return an integer between integers A and B. RANDOM(1, 10) can output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 | In Python, this would be random.randint(A, B), after importing Python&#39;s &quot;random&quot; library (import random) | JavaScript&#39;s works a little differently, with Math.random() returning a value between 0 and 1. To match Python and CollegeBoard, you could make a procedure like this | . | . | . CollegeBoard Example: What is the possible range of values for answ3 . Convert the following procedure to Python, then determine the range of outputs if n = 5. . PROCEDURE Dice(n) sum ← 0 REPEAT UNTIL n = 0 sum ← sum + RANDOM(1, 6) n ← n - 1 RETURN sum . import random # Fill in the blank n = 1 sum = 0 while n &gt; 0: sum = sum + random.randint(1 , 6) n = n - 1 break n = 0 # Code here print(sum) # Will output a range of __ to __ . 3 . Homework . Write a procedure that generates n random numbers, then sorts those numbers into lists of even and odd numbers (JS or Python, Python will be easier). . | Using NumPy and only coding in python cell, find the answer to the following questions: a. What is the derivative of 2x^5 - 6x^2 + 24x? b. What is the derivative of (13x^4 + 4x^2) / 2 when x = 9? . | Suppose you have a group of 10 dogs and 10 cats, and you want to create a random order for them.

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . def convertFahrenheit(): # code goes here return celsius convertFahrenheit(outsideTemp) . NameError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[1], line 5 1 def convertFahrenheit(): 2 # code goes here 3 return celsius -&gt; 5 convertFahrenheit(outsideTemp) NameError: name &#39;outsideTemp&#39; is not defined . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . currentGrade &lt;- currentPoints / 40 currentGrade &lt;- current Grade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; quizGrade quizGrade &lt;- currentGrade . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | . MOVE_FORWARD()|turnCorner()| ROTATE_RIGHT |MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD()|MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() MOVE_FORWARD MOVE_FORWARD() .

Lists: a sequence of variables . we can use lists to store multiple items into one variable | used to store collections of data | changeable, ordered, allow duplicates | . List examples in Python, JavaScript, and Pseudocode . fruits = [“apple”, “grape”, “strawberry”] print (fruits) . const fruits = [“apple”, “grape”, “strawberry”]; . fruits &lt;- [apple, grape, strawberry] . More List examples . brands = [“nike”, “adidas”, “underarmour”] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] truefalse = [True, False, true] . Lists are just one of four collection data types in Python . Tuple: collection that is ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates | Set: collection that is unordered, unchangeable, doesn’t allow duplicates | Dictionary: collection that is ordered, changeable, doesn’t allow duplicates | . Terms . Index: a term used to sort data in order to reference to an element in a list (allows for duplicates) | Elements: the values in the list assigned to an index | . fruits = [“apple”, “grape”, “strawberry”] index = 1 . print (fruits[index]) . Methods in Lists . append() - adds elements to the end of the list insert() - adds element at given position reverse() - reverses the lsit order count() - returns the amount of elements with the specified value clear() - removes the elements from the list . Try this . Determine the output of the code segment words &lt;- “old”, “car”, “unusual”, “new”, “bold”, “far”, “away” index &lt;- 1 FOR EACH word IN words If LEN(word) = 3 REMOVE(words, index) ELSE index &lt;- index + 1 Display(words) This will output “unusual”, “bold”, “away” | . Iteration . First, what not to do . Iteration is important for your time and sanity Coding a lot of blocks indivisually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There’s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a “for loop”, using a “for loop and range()”, using a “while loop”, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the ‘containers’ that store the data to iterate . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration: define and indefinite. Define iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? .",

            "content": "Mathematical Expression and Strings . Algorithms . An algorithm: a set of instructions that can accomplish a specific task . An Algorithm has three . Sequencing: Algorithms do taks in the order of specification | Selection: Helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision | Iteration: If a conditions is true, then the code can repeat | Algorithms can be Represented in Two Ways . 1.Flowcharts: Use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm . Aflowcharts use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm . different shapes represent different functions | For example, the circle represents the start and end whereas an arrow represents a relationship between relative shapes. There is also a rectangle, parallelogram, and diamond which have their specific functions. | Pseudocode: A blend of human language and coding format | . Arithmetic Operations . Arithmetic operations exist in most programming languages . Basic Operations . Subtraction: . represented by “-“ Ex: num1 = 2 - 1 | . Addition: . represented by “+” Ex: num1 = 2 +1 | . Multiplication . represented by “*” Ex: num1 = 2 * 1 | . Division . represented by “/” num1 = 2/1 | . Getting the Remainder represented by “MOD” (% in python) num1 = 5 % 2 . Different Uses . Items can be numbers or variables Example: num1 = 10 num2 = num1 -25 num3 = 100 * num1 num4 = num1 / num2 num5 = 9 % num4 . Order of Operations . Arithmetic operations in programming are performed in the same order as operations in mathematics: . operations in parentheses should be done first | division and multiplication should be done before addition and subtraction | modulus works similar to multiplication and division Example: Evaluate num1 num1 = 9 % 2 * (8 - 2) + 8 / (6 - 4) num1 = 10.0 | . Variables . Different Ways Values are Stored in Variables . Numerical value stored in a variable | Value of another variable stored in a variable | result of an operation stored in a variable | Result of a procedure call stored in a variable | score = 0 score = newScore score = newScore + 2 avgScore = allscores(20, 60, 80) . Sequencing is Important! . Changing the order of the steps changes the overall outcome, since every time the value assigned to a variable is changed, it overrides the last value which was assigned to the same variable. That is why it is important to track the value of variables, especially in code where the value is constantly changing. . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 + num3 num2 = num1 + num3 Vs. num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num2 = num1 + num3 num1 = num2 + num3 . Tracking Variables . Tracking variables is a common question found on AP exams and is an important thing to keep in mind when writing any code. If the value of your variables changes a lot, not accounting for these changes can result in an unwanted outcome. . var1 = 9 var2 = 7 var3 = 2 print(var1) print(var2) print(var3) .",
